I like feeling like I'm contributing to the public dialogue in some small way. It brings me a sense of fulfillment. It's important though to not let yourself be consumed by it though. I've fallen down the rabbit hole before, of getting into heated internet arguments. It's horrible for my mental health.

All that seems pretty stupidly obvious of course. Sometimes it's helpful to remind yourself of basic things though.

I think one reason why I find HN a lot less insufferable than reddit is that you can't see the number of upvotes a comment has. Being able to see the number of upvotes contributes to that fucking awful herd mentality reddit is known for.
