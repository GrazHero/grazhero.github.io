If you're anything like me, you probably have a massive problem with getting distracted by the urge to tweak the color scheme of your development environment. Whether it's Emacs or Xfce, feeling unsatisfied with my current color scheme or window manager theme is something which has to potential to massively hinder my productivity for several days. Obviously procrastination is something that most of us are susceptible to, to some degree. However, I find this particular manifestation of it to be frustrating in a unique way.

Oftentimes the catalyst for these feelings is seeing someone else's colors and deciding that mine are inadequate in some way. Then I try out some different themes that others have made, but none of them are quite perfect. There's always some little thing that bothers the hell out of me.

Another issue that tends to creep up in my mind during this process is that of cohesiveness. I like for my Emacs theme to at least sort of go along well with my GTK theme, window manager theme, and the themes of any other programs which roll their own theming system (i.e. Slack). The result is that I end up wasting even more time, and getting even more sidetracked from whatever it was I was trying to do in the first place.

I like to think of myself as someone who generally values functionality over style, but it seems that in reality my behavior is not always reflective of that kind of mindset.

I've had people say to me that they actually appreciate the restrictive nature of macOS, because it doesn't allow them to waste their own time with excessive customization. When I was younger, I would have scoffed at this. Now though, I can understand where they're coming from.

Ultimately though, I still prefer having this kind of freedom despite its shortcomings.
