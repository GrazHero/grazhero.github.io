Recently I've been getting [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0wr37CZWdc) ad on YouTube. What I immediately found funny was the 'reviewer's' completely emotionless delivery. "I'm excited, let's see what's inside," he says, although excitement is the very last emotion I would guess he's feeling based on his inflection.

It should be fairly obvious to anyone that this is in no way a legitimate review of a product. I'm pretty sure it's not even a sponsored review by an established reviewer; nothing in the video or its description gives any indication of _who_ this supposed reviewer even is. It's an advertisement masquerading as a review. 

In case you aren't yet convinced of the dishonest nature of this company's advertising, they have several other videos which follow the same format and a very similar script. Some examples [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfToHzOmwdI) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0wr37CZWdc).

As I continued getting this ad, a question crept up in my head: why the hell is this even legal? There is no disclaimer as far as I can tell. It seems to me that they want you to believe this is a real review.

Seriously, why do we as a society allow such blatantly deceptive advertising? I just don't see what good it serves. It doesn't look like the product itself is a total scam in this case, so why do they feel the need to lie?
