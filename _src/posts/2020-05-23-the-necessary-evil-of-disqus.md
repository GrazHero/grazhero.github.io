    Title: The Necessary Evil of Disqus

In the process of setting this blog up, I've decided that reader interaction is something I'd like to have. 

<!-- more -->

The easy route would be to just leave my email contact information for anyone who has any comments. This option has a few drawbacks though: 

* I feel like the number of people potentially willing to go to the trouble to send me an email isn't as large as that of people willing to leave their thoughts in an embedded comment section.
* I feel there can be a lot of value in having an open forum for discussion. Having comments be relegated to a two-way email thread means missing out on some potentially interesting points of view.

So I began to think of how best to integrate a comment section into my blog, which is built with a static site generator. For the time being, I've settled on the immensely popular Disqus. The ease of setting it up was intriguing. But it's not without some glaring drawbacks of its own, which make me hesitant to consider this a permanent solution:

* Loading external Javascript makes me very uncomfortable. 
* [Disqus' Privacy Policy](https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717103-disqus-privacy-policy) is the stuff of nightmares

So obviously it's far from ideal. I encourage any readers who are uncomfortable with Disqus to block their scripts.

I want comments though, so screw it.
