&lt;p&gt;I like feeling like I&amp;rsquo;m contributing to the public dialogue in some small way. It brings me a sense of fulfillment. It&amp;rsquo;s important though to not let yourself be consumed by it though. I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen down the rabbit hole before, of getting into heated internet arguments. It&amp;rsquo;s horrible for my mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that seems pretty stupidly obvious of course. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s helpful to remind yourself of basic things though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think one reason why I find HN a lot less insufferable than reddit is that you can&amp;rsquo;t see the number of upvotes a comment has. Being able to see the number of upvotes contributes to that fucking awful herd mentality reddit is known for.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
